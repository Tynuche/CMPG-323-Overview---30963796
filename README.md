## Branching strategy
The repository will be the main class where and the projects will be contained in.

## .gitignore file within each project
gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Although it is important to save code in source control, it is equally important for some project assets to be kept out of your repository. Before setting up a system to manage sensitive data, one needs to check whether any secret material is already present in project files. If  files or data is discovered that should not have been committed, itâ€™s important to respond appropriately to mitigate the impact of the leaked data. The right course of action will depend on how widely the repository is shared, the nature of the exposed material, and whether one wishes to scrub all mention of the leaked content or just invalidate it. If credentials are committed to the project repository, the first step should be to immediately change the password or secret to invalidate the previous value. This step should be completed regardless of or how widely the repository is shared for a few reasons.
