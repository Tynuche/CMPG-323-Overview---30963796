All projects will be done in on saperate repositories

## Branching strategy
The repository will be the main repository with that will contain the planning for the semester. The branching strategy will be each project will have its own repository.

## .gitignore file within each project
gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Although it is important to save code in source control, it is equally important for some project assets to be kept out of your repository. Before setting up a system to manage sensitive data, one needs to check whether any secret material is already present in project files. If  files or data is discovered that should not have been committed, itâ€™s important to respond appropriately to mitigate the impact of the leaked data. The right course of action will depend on how widely the repository is shared, the nature of the exposed material, and whether one wishes to scrub all mention of the leaked content or just invalidate it. If credentials are committed to the project repository, the first step should be to immediately change the password or secret to invalidate the previous value. This step should be completed regardless of or how widely the repository is shared for a few reasons.

## Project 1 - Complete
## Project 2 - Complete

Description of my project
This is a crude REST API that connects to a database. It contains a get, post, delete and patch for each controller.

## Project 3 - Complete
This is an application being hosted by azure with a shared database.

## Project 4 - Complete
This projects is a robotic process automation tool that can be used to automate user activities. The user can update, delete and create with in a single transactioin just by running the automation tool.

## Project 5 - Complete
The Connected Office Initiative (COI) involves the use of IoT devices located throughout the office complex that are connected to the network in order to acquire and exchange the data that these devices collect. Different methods might be used to communicate the data. One of these is by using visuals included in a report or dashboard. Different stakeholders may be given access to these reports or dashboards according to their level of involvement. The COI has been informed that a report would be an excellent method to track how their IoT devices are being used. This projects takes a loook at and focuses on reporting and monitoring data.
