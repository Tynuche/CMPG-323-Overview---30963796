nching strategy
The repository will be the main class where and the projects will be contained in.

## .gitignore file within each project
gitignore file tells Git which files to ignore when committing your project to the GitHub repository

## Storage of credentials and sensitive information
Although it is important to save code in source control, it it is equally important for some project assets to be kept out of your repository.
Before setting up a system to manage sensitive data, one needs to check whether any secret material is already present in project files.
